# 1st-python-project-
Learning and create new python project for the capstone project 

Some of the coding is from other website. Not 100% done by me. 

Most of the code use are found in the course that they have taught.

Please install jupiter notebook to use the file.
This course was for data science capstone project.
 
Project Scope:

Participants will be required to address a data-related problem to create a
predictive model (must be finance-related). You will acquire a real-world finance
data set, form a hypothesis about it, and then clean, parse, and apply modeling
techniques and data science principles.
  
Once we have select a dataset from kaggle:

Explore the data: perform EDA methods with visualization. Methods
include cleaning the data, handling outliers, missing values, and scaling
issues.
Build a baseline model and explain the results of the model with
visualization.
Identify limitations of dataset and results (what was missing, unknown,
what you wish you had but was unavailable, etc) when you did your
analysis.
